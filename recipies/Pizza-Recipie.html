<h2>Description</h2>
<p>So you want to make a homemade pizza? well lucky for you, you came to the right place! For this cooking lesson be caution and focus when making a pizza because to make yourself a delious yummy pizza. Without making the pizza with love (aka caution and focus) your pizza might not come out as you expected. Its always best to put your effort in making a pizza just like any other food. So with that out of the way lets get started with the list of ingredeints you need to make yourself a pizz! </p>

<h3>Ingredeints</h3>
<li> 16 ounces pizza dough </li>
<li> 1/2 cup pizza sauce </li>
<li> 8 to 20 slices pepperoni   </li>
<li> 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated </li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
<li> Flour for rolling and shaping dough </li>
<li> 1/2 cup tomato sauce </li>

<h4>Steps of Making a Pizza</h4>
<ol>Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well. </ol>
<ol>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle. </ol>
<ol>Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper. </ol>
<ol>If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. </ol>
<ol>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad. </ol>
